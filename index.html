        <p>During studies, together with cauple of friends, We took part in a game development contest. It was fun and an oppurnity to learn how to work with a team on a bigger project. Work was interesting, colleagues determined, so We won. You can check demo on YouTube:

        <br>I started my programming career as an Accenture intern and continued as a developer. It's escalated quickly because I was working with a big team on a large telecom billing system. I learnt a lot and decided that I will pick C++ as my main programming language.

        <br><p>After I gain some knowledge and skill in C++, so I decided to move on and applied to Fujitsu. Here I started from maintaining setup apps, but soon I received my own project.

    <section id='TomTom'>
        <p class="timepoint">Jan 2018</p>
        <h3>So You like maps?</h3>
        <p>After I gained even more expierence and my project in Fujitsu was mature enough, I decided to take another step. I heard that in TomTom the seniority of people is quite high, so it a perfect environment to get even more expierence. I started as a contractor, but after a few months become a FTE. Here I was working on navigation project like map rendering or processing traffic.</p>

    <section id='Ending'>
        <p class="timepoint">Now</p>
        <h3>That's it.</h3>
        <p>Now I'm continuing my programmer's journey. Still C++ is my favorite programming language, but I'm using many other technologies to develop my skills.</p>
